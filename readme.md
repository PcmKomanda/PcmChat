# About this project
In high school, we had a yearly project and this project is exactly that. I did this in 2023. It's a chat app, something like Discord, but with fewer features. The only language available is Lithuanian. I had no reason to add another language when I developed this app.


## Features

- Login with third party services(Discord, Google, GitHub)
- Create guilds like in Discord, and add text channels.
- Generate an invite code, which you send to other users.
- Join guilds with an invite code.
- Send, edit or delete messages.
- See who is online.
- Delete guilds.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/PcmKomanda/PcmChat

nano .env
```

**Launch server**

yarn start
```
## Demo

The demo is no longer available. It's already been a year and my GitHub student perks no longer cover it.
